        Sushi History Introduction
       </h2>
        <p>  Sushi began with paddy fields, where fish was fermented with vinegar, salt and rice, 
        after which the rice was discarded. 
        The earliest form of the dish, today referred to as narezushi, was created in Japan around the Yayoi period 
        . In the Muromachi period, people began to eat the rice as well as the fish.During the Edo period 
        , vinegar rather than fermented rice began to be used. The dish has become a form of food strongly associated with Japanese culture.
     The inventor of modern sushi is believed to be Hanaya Yohei, who invented nigiri-zushi, a type of sushi most known today, 
     in which seafood is placed on hand-pressed vinegared rice, around 1824 in the Edo period.
    It was the fast food of the chōnin class in the Edo period.</p>

          <div class="paragraph">Chirashi, or chirashizushi is a classic style of sushi.
             It's a bed of sushi rice and ingredients “scattered” over the top in a decorative manner. 
             Tamago, shiitake, kanpyo, and oboro are common ingredients. Raw fish is also a popular topping.
              Chirashi is often packed into a shallow rectangular or circular lacquerware box.</div>

<div class="paragraph"> "FLYING SALMON ROLL" Maki means “roll” in Japanese, so if Maki appears in the name of the dish, it is rolled. In the U.S.,
   when someone says Maki, it refers to the sushi roll, however, in Japan, the correct term to use is Makizushi. 
   Maki Sushi is considered a beginner sushi since it is one of the most popular types of 
   sushi in the world and is not adventurous as other sushi types.</div>

<div class="paragraph"> Considering the word “sashimi” comes from the Japanese words “sa” (meaning “knife”) and “shi” (meaning “fillet”), 
  it should come as no surprise that the Japanese specialty features thinly sliced raw fish. Typically, 
  the dish is served with only soy sauce so the meat can be the star of this wonderfully umami-flavored meal.
   But you might also find it accompanied by wasabi or pickled ginger.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The addition of rice is what turns sashimi into nigiri. The word “nigiri” actually comes from the Japanese term for “clasp 
  in the hand,” and these little bundles of rice are formed by hand. The dish is sometimes eaten with soy sauce and wasabi, 
  and you can find it topped with cooked ingredients, but the main components are the vinegar-flavored rice and raw fish. </div>
