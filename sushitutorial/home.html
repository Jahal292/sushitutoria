       <div class="desc"> My Tuna Tataki (Seared Tuna) is a block of sashimi tuna lightly seared and served with Ponzu dressing.
         It is almost like the Tuna Tataki dish at the world-famous chef Nobuâ€™s restaurant.This is one of the very popular and tasty dishes
          often served at Japanese restaurants. You probably pay dearly for it at restaurants, 
          but you can easily make it at home. All you need is a block of sashimi tuna and home-made Ponzu!
